    Nokogiri (鋸) makes it easy and painless to work with XML and HTML from Ruby. It provides a
    sensible, easy-to-understand API for reading, writing, modifying, and querying documents. It is
    fast and standards-compliant by relying on native parsers like libxml2 (C) and xerces (Java).

    minitest provides a complete suite of testing facilities supporting
    TDD, BDD, mocking, and benchmarking.

        "I had a class with Jim Weirich on testing last week and we were
         allowed to choose our testing frameworks. Kirk Haines and I were
         paired up and we cracked open the code for a few test
         frameworks...

         I MUST say that minitest is *very* readable / understandable
         compared to the 'other two' options we looked at. Nicely done and
         thank you for helping us keep our mental sanity."

        -- Wayne E. Seguin

    minitest/test is a small and incredibly fast unit testing framework.
    It provides a rich set of assertions to make your tests clean and
    readable.

    minitest/spec is a functionally complete spec engine. It hooks onto
    minitest/test and seamlessly bridges test assertions over to spec
    expectations.

    minitest/benchmark is an awesome way to assert the performance of your
    algorithms in a repeatable manner. Now you can assert that your newb
    co-worker doesn't replace your linear algorithm with an exponential
    one!

    minitest/mock by Steven Baker, is a beautifully tiny mock (and stub)
    object framework.

    minitest/pride shows pride in testing and adds coloring to your test
    output. I guess it is an example of how to write IO pipes too. :P

    minitest/test is meant to have a clean implementation for language
    implementors that need a minimal set of methods to bootstrap a working
    test suite. For example, there is no magic involved for test-case
    discovery.

        "Again, I can't praise enough the idea of a testing/specing
         framework that I can actually read in full in one sitting!"

        -- Piotr Szotkowski

    Comparing to rspec:

        rspec is a testing DSL. minitest is ruby.

        -- Adam Hawkins, "Bow Before MiniTest"

    minitest doesn't reinvent anything that ruby already provides, like:
    classes, modules, inheritance, methods. This means you only have to
    learn ruby to use minitest and all of your regular OO practices like
    extract-method refactorings still apply.
