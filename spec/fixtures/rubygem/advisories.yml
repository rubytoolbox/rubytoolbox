    title: Nokogiri affected by libxslt Use of Uninitialized Resource/ Use After Free
      vulnerability
    cvss_v2: 5.1
    cvss_v3: 7.5
    criticality: high
    description: |
      In xsltCopyText in transform.c in libxslt 1.1.33, a pointer variable
      isn't reset under certain circumstances. If the relevant memory area
      happened to be freed and reused in a certain way, a bounds check could
      fail and memory outside a buffer could be written to, or uninitialized
      data could be disclosed.

      Nokogiri prior to version 1.10.5 contains a vulnerable version of
      libxslt. Nokogiri version 1.10.5 upgrades the dependency to
      libxslt 1.1.34, which contains a patch for this issue.

    title: Possible XSS Vulnerability in Action Pack
    cvss_v2:
    cvss_v3: 6.1
    criticality: medium
    description: |
      There is a possible XSS vulnerability in Rails / Action Pack. This vulnerability has been
      assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2022-22577.

      Versions Affected:  >= 5.2.0
      Not affected:       < 5.2.0
      Fixed Versions:     7.0.2.4, 6.1.5.1, 6.0.4.8, 5.2.7.1

      ## Impact

      CSP headers were only sent along with responses that Rails considered as
      "HTML" responses.  This left API requests without CSP headers, which could
      possibly expose users to XSS attacks.

      ## Releases

      The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.

      ## Workarounds

      Set a CSP for your API responses manually.
